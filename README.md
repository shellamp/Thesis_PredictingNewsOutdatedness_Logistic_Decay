# Thesis_PredictingNewsOutdatedness_Logistic_Decay

The repository for my master thesis with the topic "Predicting News Outdatedness Using a Probabilistic Logistic Decay Model"

The research question is “How can a probabilistic model to predict the outdatedness of a news data using logistic decay model be developed?”

The results can be found on W&B (see results at the bottom of README) and the thesis can be found in docs (see repository structure).
